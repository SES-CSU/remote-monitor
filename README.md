# Repeater Monitor
## Background
An IoT device has been created to monitor the 240V AC normal supply, and 12V DC battery back-up supply for a radio repeater. Refer to the Project Design and Testing Document submitted along with this git repository for more information. The purpose of this git repository is to:
* Store the Arduino firmware backups for deploying new devices, or adding functionality
* Store relevent hardware manuals

To facilitate continuous deployment of the web application, it has been moved to a separate git repository. Updates to the web application should be made within this repository: [Repeater Monitor Web Application](https://github.com/tarrantja/remote-monitor-web). Updates made to the web application contained within this repository will not be deployed.
